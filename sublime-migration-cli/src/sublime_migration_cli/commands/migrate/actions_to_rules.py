    This command associates actions with rules in the destination instance,

    Rules are matched by name and source_md5. Actions are matched by name and type.

        # Migrate all action associations
        sublime migrate actions-to-rules --source-api-key KEY1 --dest-api-key KEY2
        
        # Migrate action associations for specific rules
